Create an n8n workflow that responds to an HTTP webhook when a CSV file of leads is uploaded. It should parse the CSV content, validate mandatory fields (name, email, company), enrich each lead via a "lead scoring" HTTP API, filter out leads with scores below a threshold, store the remaining ones in a table-like node, and send a Slack message summarizing how many leads were accepted vs rejected.
