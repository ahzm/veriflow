Construct a workflow that, upon receiving a webhook from a Git hosting service about a merged pull request, fetches repository metadata, looks up the author and reviewers in an internal directory API, posts a formatted summary to a Slack channel, increments a "developer score" counter in a mock database node, and sends a weekly digest email to engineering management summarizing all merged PRs.
