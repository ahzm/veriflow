Design an n8n workflow that monitors a shared "operations@company.com" inbox, classifies incoming emails into incident types (outage, performance degradation, security alert, general request) using a simple rules-based approach, creates or updates a ticket in a mock ITSM system via HTTP API, notifies the on-call Slack channel, and escalates to a manager if the ticket has been open longer than 4 hours.
