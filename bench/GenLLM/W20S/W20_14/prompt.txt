Construct a workflow that manages internal maintenance requests: a webhook receives a JSON payload describing an issue (location, category, urgency), the workflow assigns it to a mock "facility team" API, updates a tracking table, sends a Slack notification to the team, waits for a simulated "completed" callback via another webhook, and then emails the requester with a completion summary.
