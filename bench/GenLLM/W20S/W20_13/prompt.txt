Design an n8n workflow to handle a simple recruitment pipeline: whenever a candidate submits an application via HTTP, store the candidate info, send an acknowledgement email, evaluate the CV using a mock "screening score" API, route strong candidates to a "screening_passed" list, send a Slack notification to recruiters, and schedule a follow-up email if there is no response after 3 days.
