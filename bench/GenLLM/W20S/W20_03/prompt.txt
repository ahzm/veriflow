Build a workflow that listens to a webhook for new user sign-ups, checks whether the domain of the email address belongs to a list of high-value companies, enriches the user profile via a mock "company lookup" API, stores the combined data into a database-like node, triggers a Slack notification to the sales team channel, and sends a personalized welcome email including a discount code computed from simple rules.
