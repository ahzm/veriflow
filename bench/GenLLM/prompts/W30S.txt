W30_16
Build an n8n workflow to manage a research experiment pipeline: on manual trigger, load a configuration object describing experiment variants and sample sizes, send invitations to participants via email, record responses and completion statuses arriving via webhook, compute simple aggregate statistics (completion rate per variant), and store the results into an "experiments" table.

W30_17
Create a workflow that automates a simple "backup verification" process: every night, call a mock backup API to list completed backups, verify integrity checksums via another API endpoint, log verification results in a "backup_log" table, send an email summary of successes and failures to the infrastructure team, and raise a critical alert via Slack if any backup failed verification.

W30_18
