Construct an n8n workflow that coordinates a "VIP customer incident" protocol: when a critical incident event involving a VIP customer is received via webhook, fetch customer details from a CRM API, notify the dedicated VIP support Slack channel, send personalized apology emails to the customer contact, create tasks for follow-up actions in a "task manager" API, and store a full incident record into a "vip_incidents" table.
