Design an n8n workflow that handles periodic compliance checks: fetch a list of required compliance documents and their expiration dates from a mock compliance API, determine which documents are missing or expired for each business unit, send summary emails to compliance officers, create tickets in a mock ticketing system for units with critical gaps, and post a high-level summary to a Slack channel.
