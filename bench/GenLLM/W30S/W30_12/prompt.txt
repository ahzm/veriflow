Build a workflow that manages a recurring training reminder: maintain a list of employees and their mandatory training deadlines in a mock database node, run daily, identify employees whose training expires within 30, 7, and 1 day, send reminder emails with different messages for each interval, notify managers by Slack for overdue training, and log all reminders into a tracking collection.
