Create a workflow that automates synchronization between a marketing signup form and a CRM: when a new signup is received via webhook, validate and normalize contact data, check whether the contact already exists in CRM via HTTP API, create or update the record accordingly, assign a lead score based on simple rules, send a welcome email, and log the operation in a "lead_sync" table.
