Define an n8n workflow for event-based dynamic pricing: receive product demand events via webhook, aggregate counts per product over time windows, compute suggested price adjustments based on simple elasticity rules from a configuration node, send updated pricing recommendations via an HTTP API to a mock pricing engine, and notify a Slack channel whenever large adjustments are suggested.
