Build an n8n workflow for automated release notes generation: on a weekly schedule, fetch merged pull requests from a mock Git API, group them by component and label (feature, bugfix, improvement), generate a structured release notes text, store it into a "release_notes" collection, send the notes by email to an internal "releases" list, and post an abbreviated version to a Slack channel.
