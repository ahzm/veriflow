Create a workflow that manages invoice approval and payment notification: on arrival of a new invoice payload, validate required fields and compute tax totals, determine whether manager approval is required based on amount and cost center, send approval emails and wait for approval callbacks, once approved call a mock "payment" API, and email both the supplier and finance team with the outcome.
