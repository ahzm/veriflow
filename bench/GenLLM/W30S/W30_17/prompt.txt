Create a workflow that automates a simple "backup verification" process: every night, call a mock backup API to list completed backups, verify integrity checksums via another API endpoint, log verification results in a "backup_log" table, send an email summary of successes and failures to the infrastructure team, and raise a critical alert via Slack if any backup failed verification.
