Design a workflow that manages internal incident postmortem collection: when an incident is marked as "resolved" via webhook, look up all involved teams and owners, send them emails with a postmortem template link, track responses arriving via another webhook, aggregate key data points (root cause, time to detect, time to resolve) into a "postmortems" table, and email a consolidated report to leadership.
