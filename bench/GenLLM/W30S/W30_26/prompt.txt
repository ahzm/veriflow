Define an n8n workflow that orchestrates a simple partner revenue sharing calculation: at month end, fetch transaction logs from a mock commerce API, group transactions by partner ID, compute revenue shares based on partner-specific percentages stored in a configuration node, write payout records into a "partner_payouts" table, and email payout summaries as CSV attachments to each partner contact.
