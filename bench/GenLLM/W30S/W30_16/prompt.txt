Build an n8n workflow to manage a research experiment pipeline: on manual trigger, load a configuration object describing experiment variants and sample sizes, send invitations to participants via email, record responses and completion statuses arriving via webhook, compute simple aggregate statistics (completion rate per variant), and store the results into an "experiments" table.
