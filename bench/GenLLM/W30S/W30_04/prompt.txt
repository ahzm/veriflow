Define a workflow that automates a simple procurement approval: a webhook receives purchase requests, validates required fields (requester, amount, cost center, description), routes requests above a threshold to a manager approval email, waits for an approval/decline callback via a second webhook, updates a mock procurement system over HTTP, and sends final outcome emails to the requester and finance.
