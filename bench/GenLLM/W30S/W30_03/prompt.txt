Build an n8n workflow that orchestrates a multi-step marketing campaign: on schedule, fetch a list of eligible contacts from a CRM-like API, segment them by region and industry, generate region-specific message templates, send initial campaign emails, schedule follow-up emails after 5 days only for contacts who did not open the first message (simulated via a mock "email events" API), and log all actions into a tracking table.
