Create a workflow that coordinates a quarterly business review report: on manual trigger, query three different departmental metrics APIs (sales, support, engineering), aggregate KPIs into a single JSON structure, generate a plain-text executive summary, store the report in a "qbr_reports" collection, and send notification emails with links to the stored report to the leadership team.
