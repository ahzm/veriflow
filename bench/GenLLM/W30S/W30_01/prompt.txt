Design an n8n workflow that manages a full onboarding process for new employees: trigger from an HTTP webhook when HR submits a new hire form, create entries in a mock HR system and a mock identity management API, generate an initial password reset email, assign a laptop asset in an inventory API, create a Slack account and invite the user to three standard channels, and send a final confirmation email to HR summarizing all steps and their status.
