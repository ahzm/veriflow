Construct a workflow that manages a knowledge base curation loop: when a support agent submits a "candidate article" via webhook, validate structure and tags, store it in a "draft_articles" table, notify a group of reviewers via Slack, wait for review decisions (approve/reject) via HTTP callbacks, move approved articles into a "published_articles" table, and email the original author about the decision.
